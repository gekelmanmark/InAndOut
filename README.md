# InAndOut

This is a project that follows a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqD-NJf7-OM&ab_channel=tutorialsEU) in order to help understand the basics of `CRUD` operations and database management. The framework used in this project is `.NET using C#`.

# How to run this application:

This application is contained within the directory labeled `InAndOut` and self-hosts the app using a webserver called `Kestrel`. In order to get this application running you would need to:
1. Open a `command prompt` window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project `.json` file.
3. Run the command: `dotnet run`. This of course requires you to have `Visual Studio` installed on your computer.
4. Once everything builds, compiles and runs automatically, you should be greeted with a messege saying something like:
    
    `Now listening on: http://localhost:5151`

5. Now, open up your browser and navigate to that URL. You are now able to use the app!

# Details about any further changes
The focus for these types of projects is to use the correct developing techniques in order to make the most efficient code. It is also to learn how to use the framework and begin to understand the fundementals. Naturally, in a tutorial like this you cannot go into depth about how to make something as perfect as it can be. The aim is quantity over quality. Start the project, develope it, and most importantly finish it.

This is why this project does not have all the complete components of a commercial website that you would see on a day-to-day basis. The aim was to make a functional website that had the necessary functionality in order to become a fully fleshed out resource.

This finally brings us to the heading of this section. The next step for this mock website is to add the `graphical user interface (GUI)`
